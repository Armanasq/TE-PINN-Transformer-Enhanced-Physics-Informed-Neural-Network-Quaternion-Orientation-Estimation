# TE-PINN-Transformer-Enhanced-Physics-Informed-Neural-Network-Quaternion-Orientation-Estimation
A Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Network for accurate orientation estimation using IMU data. This repository integrates transformer networks with rigid body dynamics, multi-head attention, and RK4-based quaternion integration, optimized for embedded systems. TE-PINN reduces mean error by 36.8% and computational complexity by 25%.
